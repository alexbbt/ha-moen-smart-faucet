# Example configuration for Moen Smart Water integration
# This is for reference only - the integration uses config flow

# If you want to use YAML configuration instead of config flow,
# you can add this to your configuration.yaml:

# moen_smart_water:
#   client_id: "your_client_id_here"
#   username: "your_email@example.com"
#   password: "your_password_here"

# However, it's recommended to use the config flow UI for better security
# and easier management.
