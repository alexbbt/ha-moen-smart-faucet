# Cursor Rules for Moen Smart Faucet Integration

## Python Environment
- Always use the virtual environment located at `./venv/`
- When running Python commands, scripts, or tests, activate the virtual environment first
- Use `source ./venv/bin/activate` before running any Python-related commands
- When suggesting terminal commands, always include the virtual environment activation

## Code Style and Standards
- Follow Python PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Maintain consistent error handling patterns
- Follow Home Assistant integration patterns and conventions

## Project Structure
- This is a Home Assistant custom component for Moen Smart Faucet integration
- Main code is in `custom_components/moen_smart_water/`
- Test scripts are in `scripts/`
- Always consider Home Assistant compatibility when making changes

## Dependencies
- Check `requirements.txt` and `requirements-test.txt` for project dependencies
- When adding new dependencies, update the appropriate requirements file
- Use the virtual environment for all package installations

## Testing
- Run tests using the virtual environment
- Use `python -m pytest` or similar testing commands within the activated venv
- Ensure all tests pass before suggesting code changes

## File Operations
- Prefer absolute paths when possible
- Be mindful of the Home Assistant custom component structure
- Maintain proper imports and module organization
